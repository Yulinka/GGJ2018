[About File Naming]
-Ladies traits: Cute, Hot, Fat
-Gents traits: Fat, Hot, Skinny
-Most file names will be Trait-Gender-Part-Color OR Trait-Gender-Part#-Color for items that have different customizations (i.e. Cute-Lady-Hat2-Green)
-i.e. Hot-Lady-Hat-Silver
-i.e. Fat-Gent-Suit-Black
-All #'s in the file name indicate that it's the same style (Hat1 are all one style, Hair2 are all one style)
-The files that do NOT match this pattern are: Glasses, Hats, Suits/Dresses, and Bases
-Glasses do not have a color name in the file since they are always black (i.e. Hot-Lady-Glasses)
-Hats are universal and can fit on any character, they just need to be placed correctly onto the head and they are named Gender-Part#-Color (i.e. Lady-Hat1-Red)
-Suits/Dresses do not have a # because there is only 1 type per gender (i.e. Hot-Lady-Dress-Blue)
-Bases are named Trait-Gender-Face#-Color (i.e. Hot-Lady-Face3-Dark)
-Face1 and Face2 will always be young-ish (Face1 is nice, Face2 is stern/serious) looking faces whereas Face3 will always be an elderly looking face
-Skin colors are named as follows: White, Cream, Brown, Dark (cream is yellow-ish and white is pink-ish)
-All items that are Grey in color are named Silver (to prevent misspellings)
-Yellow hair is named Blonde
-Yellow items are Gold for sake of smaller name files


[About Glasses]
-Glasses are universal
-They will fit on the faces that they are meant for
-There is one pair of glasses per face
-They will need to be moved around slightly to fit over the eyes


[About Mixing Customisations]
-Do not mix Red and Green items together (i.e. No red hat + green dress, no green hat + red dress)
-Do not mix Black/Silver hair with Black/Silver items (i.e. No silver hair + silver dress BUT silver hair is OK with black dress)
-Do not mix Blonde hair with Gold items
-Do not mix Brown hair with Dark Brown skin - Dark Brown skin only pairs with Black hair
-Do not mix Blonde hair with Dark Brown and Brown skin


[Known Issues]
-Lady-Hat3 style is difficult to see the color of the hat aside from Red, Gold, Silver, and possibly Green
-Perhaps it would be best to barely utilize/not utilize the Lady-Hat3 Black and Blue
